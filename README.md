# Death
* There are no negative HPs. When a character reaches 0 HP he/she is unconsious.
* When at 0 HP and you take damage equal to or greater than you max HP you are dead.
* When you start your turn at 0 HP you must make a death saving throw, once each turns. 3 successes mean that you are stabilized, 3 failures means you are dead, whichever comes first. A roll of 1 means 2 failures, a roll of 20 means 2 successes.
* The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. Otherwise, stablize it.
* Healing:
  * Healing spells (Cure wounds and a lot more https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/133286/what-spells-are-available-to-heal-characters-increase-their-max-hp-or-grant-te)

## Why hide?
* You can gain a surprise round at the beginning of combat.
* Opponents have disadvantage on attack roll
* You gain advantage on attack roll.
* Many spells cannot target you
* You can move without being seen or heard at 2/3 speed
## Mechanics
* Dexterity (Stealth) check against Wisdom (Perception) of those actively searching, passive perception for others.
* Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) if environment is lightly obscured.
## When can you hide?
* When an enemy cannot clearly see you. You can always hide when you are invisible.
## Invisible = Hide?
* No. Invisiblity refers only to sight. Hiding applies to sight, hearing and movement.

# Homebrew and other sources

## Being on fire
The creature on fire takes 1d4 / 1d10 fire damage at the start of its turn, until someone takes an action to douse the fire (MM 125). Alchemists Fire: A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.

## The healing potion rule
Healing potions always yield maximum hit points. However, their availability is limited in some way.

## The critical damage rule
Critical damage is always (max dice damage) + (dice roll) + modifiers. For example, a weapon with damage of 1d8 + 3 would do 8 + 1d8 + 3.
